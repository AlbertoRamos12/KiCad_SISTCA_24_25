# KiCad_SISTCA_24_25
A collection of KiCad projects developed throughout a technical report, aimed at helping students study PCB design and circuit schematics through concrete examples.

# KiCad Project Collection – Learning Examples

This repository contains three KiCad projects developed as part of a technical report, aiming to support students in learning electronic circuit design and PCB layout using KiCad.

## 📁 Contents

The repository includes the following projects:

- **Example – Audio Amplifier Circuit:** Demonstrates the creation of a simple analog amplification circuit, focusing on schematic design and basic PCB layout.
- **Exercise – Boost Converter:** A DC-DC converter design with attention to component selection and layout for switching circuits.
- **Challenge – USBASP Programmer:** A more complex digital circuit with USB interface, intended to simulate a real-world PCB development scenario.

Each folder includes the full KiCad project files, including schematics, PCB layouts, and any custom libraries used during development.

## 🎯 Purpose

These projects were developed during the creation of a technical report and are made available here so that students can consult and learn from them. Whether revisiting concepts that were not fully understood or seeking concrete examples to support theory, these files offer practical insight into real circuit design using KiCad.

They are intended to help students:

- Understand the process of schematic capture and PCB design.
- Perform Electrical Rule Checks (ERC) and Design Rule Checks (DRC).
- Learn how to manage layout, routing, and component organization.
- Explore progressively complex circuits, from analog to digital.
